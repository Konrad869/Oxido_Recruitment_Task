(Hello I am submitting a task unfortunately I was not able to generate the Html code or the Html file the problem was that every time I typed in the command and the file name of the Article to generate the Html code from the JavaScript code a 401 message was displayed and the information that the key given was not valid).

The way the application works -

1- The application Loads the text file with the article.
2- OpenAI API configurations.
3- The function generates HTML code from the article text.
4- Saves the generated HTML code to a file.
The way the application is launched - I am not able to specify
